1. Disliked www.citi.com: At first glance, the website is fine as far as design goes. Login is available on the main page. However as a customer the UI after I login is one of the worst compared to banking websites. It's usable but not comfortable to eyes compared to chase.com

2. Liked: www.chase.com: Similar to citi.com, chase also has a login prompt easily visible to the user as well as promos  just like citi. But as a customer chase has better UI design for managing my accounts and making payments. ALthough both sites provide the same functionality I'd rather use chase online due to its comfortable UI which has clearer prompts for the user with more minimalistic design. Definitely not as cluttered as citi.com

3. Liked: https://gazettetimes.com/ : I came accross this website when researching information for a paper last term. I checked back to see how the home page looks and I'm impressed how easy on the eyes it is. The spacing between article links is helpful to make it look less cluttered. THe white font contrasts well with the black background.

4. Disliked https://www.theguardian.com/us : I like the guardian for news but I'm not a fan of the website design. Compared to the local paper above its very cluttered. The font color choices don't help ease the clutterness. The site is functional and since they are a larger news organization they have more stories to link on their main page but the organization of the articles is not pleasing to the user.

5. Disliked https://store.steampowered.com/ : The steam client is much better than the website. Although this is a no brainer to a steam gamer. The bad user experience was reported by a family member who wanted to send me a steam card digitally as supposed to buying one in store. Steam does not clearly inform new users that they can not send gift cards until 2 weeks have passed after creating their account. I had to find this information separately on a different steam page explaining the issue behind this. This makes sense to prevent fraudsters from tricking victims however, this should be clearer during the account creation process and before money is allowed to be added to the wallet.
